                        <center> <p>The history of human civilisation is a history of development, each generation learning from the experience of earlier generations, making their own achievements and contributing their work to the knowledge to be inherited by the next generation. Even a generation which is radical in its approach, changing much of what it has inherited, has its experience to contribute to the next generation. We learn about the achievements and the failures of the past from our parents, from our teachers, from the structures of the society in which we live. In that learning process, a process which goes on throughout our life, libraries can have a very important role. They preserve the written memory of our civilisation, a memory which mankind developed to be more reliable and permanent than the oral tradition. Is it an exaggeration to say that civilisation would have lost its written record if it had not been for librarians? Certainly many ancient works would have been lost if a cautious librarian in one generation had not preserved them.</p></center>
