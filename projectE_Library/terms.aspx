                            <p>Do respect the library staff and obey their instructions. They are amiable and smart people that sadly face a considerable lack of respect towards their profession. Don’t be afraid to ask them about recommended books or their whereabouts, as long as your questions remain sensible, librarians give you answers more helpful than you would expect.</p>
                            <P>Don’t be noisy. The library is one of the few quiet public spaces (that are free!) used by mostly students and researchers. Some libraries have designated areas for group study that allow you to communicate with your friends if you need to, but if not, be considerate of others and keep conversations to a minimum.</p>
                            <p>Do bring water and food (if allowed) to keep you refreshed and alert during work. It is essential for you to properly fuel your body and brain, something that is often forgotten during long cramming sessions. However, don’t eat noisy or smelly food. Even if it’s a subtle smell, it can cause discomfort and annoyance among your desk neighbours. The same applied to your feet – no one cares for smelly feet, so please don’t take your shoes off and plan comfortable attire instea</p>
